Note on ELE Ping
=====================
RT118x ELE requires ping every 24 hours, which is mandatory, otherwise soc may reset.
Note:
1.  This is generic rule for all RT118x demos.
2.  Most of RT118x demos don't ping ELE every 24 hours, that is because those demos focus on the function demonstrate only.
    It is still MUST to ping ELE every 24 hours if demo run duration > 24 hours.
3.  Please refer to hello_world as an example.
